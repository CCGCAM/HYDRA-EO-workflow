This section summarises the HYDRA-EO work packages (WPs), outlining their scope, role, and position within the overall project timeline. Each work package contributes a specific set of activities—ranging from scientific requirements and data collection to modelling, integration, and dissemination—together forming a coherent end-to-end workflow.
