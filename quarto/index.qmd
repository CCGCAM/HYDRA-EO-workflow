# HYDRA-EO official workflow repository <span></span>

::: {.hero-text}
This official page summarises the main processing pipelines, methodological choices and software components developed within HYDRA-EO. It is intended for the consortium (WU-DES, WENR-WUR, CNR-IBE, CIAG-IRIAF) and should not be shared outside ESA and project partners without prior agreement.

## Processing pipelines by data source

Pipelines are organised by data source and level of processing. Each pipeline folder in the repository should contain a README.md describing inputs, steps, outputs and links to scripts or notebooks.

UAV/airborne
:::

### UAV & airborne processing

Radiometric and geometric correction of UAV and airborne hyperspectral/thermal data, mosaicking, BRDF normalisation and co-registration with field plots. Output products include surface reflectance cubes, temperature maps and quality masks.

Satellite EO processing
:::

### Satellite EO processing

Sentinel-2, PRISMA and EnMAP workflows (e.g. Sen2Cor atmospheric correction, spectral resampling, tiling and time-series aggregation), harmonised across sites for crop-stressor analysis and EO upscaling.
:::

::: {.pill-mini}
RTM library & hybrid ML
:::

### Hybrid ML methods

PROSAIL / SCOPE forward simulations via ToolsRTM and SCOPEinR, LUT generation, plant trait retrieval, and hybrid ML models trained on combined RTM–EO features for stress detection
