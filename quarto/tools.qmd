## Software used in HYDRA-EO tutorials

This page summarises the core software tools and R packages used
throughout the HYDRA-EO tutorials. These tools support radiative
transfer modelling, energy balance simulations, and hybrid approaches
for vegetation trait retrieval, disease detection, and ecosystem
monitoring.

### ToolsRTM

**ToolsRTM** is an R package developed within HYDRA-EO to support
forward radiative transfer simulations at leaf and canopy level. It
provides implementations and wrappers for widely used RTMs, enabling
consistent simulation of reflectance and fluorescence across multiple
sensors.

Main capabilities include PROSAIL-based canopy reflectance simulations,
band convolution to satellite spectral response functions, and
harmonisation across multispectral and hyperspectral platforms.

-   Forward simulations of **PROSAIL**, **INFORM**, **SPART**, and
    **MARMIT**
-   Sensor-specific band aggregation
-   Designed for teaching, prototyping, and research workflows

### SCOPEinR

**SCOPEinR** provides an R interface to the SCOPE model, allowing users
to simulate canopy energy balance, photosynthesis, land surface
temperature, and sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) in a reproducible and
scriptable environment.

Within HYDRA-EO tutorials, SCOPEinR is used to link radiative transfer
with physiological processes and flux-related variables, supporting the
interpretation of hyperspectral and thermal observations.

-   Canopy energy balance and flux simulations
-   Temperature and SIF modelling
-   Integration with RTM-based and machine learning workflows
