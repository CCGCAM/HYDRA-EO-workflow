## Processing pipelines by data source

This section documents key methodological blocks: radiative transfer configurations, trait retrieval strategies and disease scoring.

<div class="pill-mini">UAV-airborne processing</div>

### UAV & airborne processing

Radiometric and geometric correction of UAV and airborne hyperspectral and thermal data,
including mosaicking, BRDF normalisation, and co-registration with field plots.
Output products include surface reflectance cubes, temperature maps, and quality masks.

<div class="pill-mini">Satellite</div>

### Satellite EO processing

Sentinel-2, PRISMA, and EnMAP workflows (e.g. Sen2Cor atmospheric correction, spectral resampling,
tiling, and time-series aggregation), harmonised across sites for crop-stressor analysis
and EO upscaling.

<div class="pill-mini">RTM-ML</div>

### RTM library & hybrid ML

PROSAIL and SCOPE forward simulations via **ToolsRTM** and **SCOPEinR**, LUT generation,
plant trait retrieval, and hybrid ML models trained on combined RTM–EO features
for crop stress detection.
